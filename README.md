# snRNAseq-workflows

This repository contains reproducible **single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) analysis workflows**
used in real research projects, covering quality control, normalization, integration,
clustering, annotation, and downstream analyses.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate **practical, research-grade snRNA-seq pipelines**
with an emphasis on:
- biological interpretability
- reproducibility
- clean, modular code
